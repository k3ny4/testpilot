This website requires installed npm, node.js and express.js on your computer. If you don't have it, you can install npm according to official guidance for npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
And, also, install Node.js in official website: https://nodejs.org/en
After that, open terminal and write:
npm -v
npm install express
cd /diploma/server
node server.js

If you want to start server again, just write npm start in terminal, but be sure that you're on right directory for a correct work.
